🚧 Note: The View Report Details, Pricing, and Profile sections are still under development. However, the core functionality of the app is live—you can interact with AI-powered doctors specialized in various fields to assist with your health concerns.

💡 I’ve intentionally left out the Pricing section, as this project is not meant for commercial purposes at the moment. The goal is to make specialized AI doctor assistance accessible to everyone, completely free.

🤝 That said, if any individual or organization is interested in collaborating, I’m open to discussions! Let’s work together to refine and scale this solution based on your needs.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
